My granddaughter Jaclyn McKinney age 36 was found in a fetal position too close to the track. she was hit by a Norfolk Southern train. This happened in Phila Pa at the 3633 I Street area in Phila. It is in the 24th District Police. By calling all rail lines I found Helen of Conrail. Helen was nice enough to take her film to Dr. Simon of the Phila. Medical Examiners office, which when viewing Dr. Simon said it was an accident. She also took the film to Phila. for my grandson John McKinney, Jaclyns brother. Helen could not answer the questions that I need answered. Jaclyn had a baby on April 25, 2018, and now Ashley has no mother. I will list the things I need in a report, answered and sent to me. Please, right away. We have a baby in foster care and I need answers to the DHS Dept. so they do not put Ashley up for adoption. I am 82 years old & I hardly ever get out of house. Hard to breathe when I walk & I can't walk by myself & I am on oxygen 24/7. Limited to phone calls & writing letters. Very important to get a quick response. 1. On June 2nd at 8:00 Amtrack [sic] was called by what train Co. They reported woman walking on tracks. They Amtrack [sic] responded by calling calling the 24th Dist. Police, who said they didn't see anyone. I called the 24th Dist. & they do not have a record of this, so they say. 2. New Jersey Transit stopped at 11:55 PM to report about a body on track. Train operator #4697. I need to know what track the train was on. I was told Jaclyn was on 3rd. She laid on the tracks from 9:05 to 11:55 PM. How come he saw her and the Norfolk Southern didn't. Wouldn't warnings have been sent to all tracks that would be in the area of 3633 I Street from 8:00 PM on to be very cauctious [sic]. 24th Dist, came out at 12:25 or close & the Detectives around 1:15 AM. Have a report of the 1st 2 officer. But Detectives tell me they don't give reports. 3. I need to know how many trains ran in the 3633 I St. area in Phila. from 7:30 PM to 12 midnight. I need to know their names & the tracks they were on. 4. How many cars were on the Norfolk train running on the Conrail Line. Was it just an engine or were their freight cars connected to engine? 5. Can you find out from the 24th district why they told me they have no report on the 8:00 PM call to them The case number DC 2018-24-045-956 Amtrack [sic] would not lie about that. 6. FROM 9:00 PM TO 11:55 PM IMPORTANT WHERE THERE ANY OTHER TRAINS AFTER NORFOLK SOUTHERN ON THE TRACK WHERE JACLYN WAS. I have asked 6 questions. Please send me your report and all the answers of the train companies. Appreciate it very much and I need this report almost immediately. It will be 2 months sense it happened or June 2, 2015. P.S.

2020-APP-00004,"Thank you so much for your response. However, this does not answer my question and is not what I expected. This is not a ridership study, it is a paper on a ridership study. In particular, the assumption that the Thruways bus between Houston and Longview is highly suspect. Especially as that bus actually goes between Galveston and Longview with stops in Houston and Nacogdoches. Furthermore, this so-called ridership study does not show pricing. Texas Central states that on the low end, a one-way ticket price for the HSR would be $131. This is considerably more than the low-cost Thruways bus. You cant determine ridership without ticket price. The Thruways bus is faster than the HSR by over an hour heading towards Houston and a little faster than the HSR heading away from Houston. It seems extremely unlikely that Amtrak would eliminate the Thruways bus and no doubt some of the secret drafts contain ridership numbers while retaining the Thruways bus, which no doubt approach zero since people dont want to pay more for a longer trip."
2021-APP-00001,"Unity Electric Discount, LLC (Unity) is appealing FOIA's ruling to withhold portions of the records that Unity requested, based on FOIA Exemption 4. Exemption 4 protects trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is that is obtained from outside the government and that is privileged and confidential. Unity's position is that Unity should be provided contract information on all power procurement contracts between CES and Amtrak over the period August 22, 2013 through December 31, 2017. Unity never violated the CES/Unity agreement. CES breached its duty and obligation as they for some reason stopped providing Unity this Amtrak power procurement information. This information will verify all CES and Amtrak contracts executed during the period October 22, 2013 and December 31, 2017. Note that the information we are requesting is the same information we had once requested and received from CES and/or Amtrak, and it was not privileged, confidential, or providing trade secrets. Other considerations for our appeal follow: 1)	Unity selected CES to be our partner to win Amtrak power procurement contracts. 2)	Unity's role included: identifying Amtrak opportunities; arranging meetings and conferences between CES/ Unity, and Amtrak energy procurement staff /consultants); assisting in RFP analysis and pricing; and, providing the minority business inclusion component for CES and Amtrak. 3)	Unity entered a subcontractor agreement with ConEdison Solutions to provide power supply for any Amtrak RFPs/Quotes/Confirmations. This agreement was effective over the period August 22, 2013 to December 31, 2017. 4)	According to the Unity /CES agreement, ""unless prohibited by Amtrak, Unity was required by Amtrak and the CES/Unity agreement to provide Unity copies of all procurement-related documents (including SBD preference or set-aside evaluation factors, customer account information, requested product description, and contract term and structure), or from Con Edison Solutions if ConEdison Solutions has itself received these documents directly from Amtrak"". (See attached Unity/CES Independent Contractor Agreement, Item 8) 5)	Unity was provided contract information on the Amtrak 30th Street Station contract, and pricing information on RFPs. 6) It is unfair for CES or Amtrak to refuse to give Unity information which Unity is entitled to per the CES/Unity contract arrangement. Unity does not agree with CES' or Amtrak's reason for not providing this information to Unity, especially given the provisions of the CES / Unity agreement as stated in 4) above."

Thank you for your assistance, Chelsea Sarkauskas ckopkas@gmail.com (Date Range for Record Search: From 01/16/2008 To 01/17/2008) Amtrak provided an estimated delivery date of November 3, 2021. There was a significant delay in receiving the requested information. As the delivery day came and went, I attempted to obtain updates as to the status of my request, but had great difficulty in getting a response. I reached out through the FOIA portal on the Amtrak website, as well as e-mails and phone messages to both Rebecca Connor, Records Manager, and Syeda Maghrabi, Senior Associate General Counsel. The image below is from the FOIA Portal on the Amtrak website. It illustrates some of my attempts to contact an Amtrak representative. The response to my FOIA request finally arrived on 5/12/22, over 6 months later than the supposed delivery date. While the time delay does violate the Freedom of Information Act, it is not the main reason for my appeal. I was provided with most of the information that could be found pursuant to my request.

The decision was made in error and the external video of the Amtrak train must be released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The goal of FOIA is to promote disclosure of information by the government and its agencies. FOIA mandates that agency disclose records on request unless the requested information falls within the nine listed exemptions. The United States Supreme Court held these exemptions are explicitly made exclusive and must be narrowly applied. Milner v. Department of Navy, 131 S.Ct. 1259, (2011). Expanding the scope ofFOIA is intended to create a citizen-centered and results-oriented approach that improves service and performance while avoiding disputes and related litigation. Exec. Order No. 13392, 70 FR 75373, reprinted as amended in 5 U.S.C. § 552. The video sought in request 23-FOI-003336 pertains to the external video from an Amtrak train that struck a passenger vehicle. Neither of the claimed exemptions, b(5) or b(6), to withhold the video are applicable in this case. The b( 5) exception cannot apply because the video does not pertain to any inter or intra-agency memoranda or letters. Nor does the video include any relevant personnel or medical files that would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. FOIA exemption b( 6) is applicable only where the files are highly personal. Dep 't of State v. Washington Post Co., 456 U.S. 595 (I 982). Moreover, the requirement that disclosure causes a ""clearly unwarranted"" invasion of privacy places a thumb on the scale in favor of disclosure. National Archives and Records Admin. V Favish, 541 U.S. 157, 165-66 (2004). Because the occupants of the vehicle were on a public road at the time of the accident, they were not subject to a constitutionally protected privacy interest. Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967) (holding that what one voluntarily exposes to the public is not subject to Fourth Amendment privacy protections). Without any privacy interests to protect, the b( 6) exemption cannot apply. Therefore, the video requested in 23-FOI-00336 must be disclosed. Notably, Rush County is named in the tort claim notice. This video is necessary for Rush County to defend itself in litigation. Failure to produce the video will result in harm to Rush County.

Code § 2-531 to 2-540. According to the letter, Amtrak is withholding the request information ""entirely"" under FOIA Exemption 4. DDP does not agree with Amtrak's decision and as such, files this appeal pursuant to D.C. Code§ 2-537 and 49 CFR §701.10. First, it is improper to deny the request entirely because Exemption 4 under FOIA covers only two categories, 1) trade secrets and 2) commercial or financial information. This would include, for example, confidential pricing information, internal processes and procedures, financial statements, etc. The exemption, however, would not include proposals publicly available, cover letters, sample forms, etc. Any confidential information or trade secrets can be redacted from the documents. Further, Exemption 4 does not cover internal documents such as internally produced notes, metrics, surveys regarding the proposals and evaluations of the proposals. If these documents contain any specific protected information, it can be redacted here as well. For the above-mentioned reasons, DDP appeals the denial and formally requests Amtrak comply with the provisions of D.C Code§ 2-534 to 2-540 by providing the entire requested record either with information deemed to fall under Exemption 4 redacted, or providing all documents that,do not fall under the exemption as discussed above.

2024-APP-00006,"Dear Executive Vice President Acheson: Pursuant to the federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, I hereby appeal Amtrak's (b) (5) withholdings in Cato request 24-FOI-00169, regarding the Amtrak Texas High-Speed Rail Corridor project. In its February 21, 2024, response to Cato, Rebecca Connor of Amtrak's FOIA office stated as follows: ""We are withholding this information in full under FOIA Exemption 5."" Ms. Connor did not explain in any further detail the specific (b) (5) invocation she relied upon to deny the records in question. Our reading of the available facts involving the parties in this case leads Cato to conclude that the privileges of 1) attorney work product, 2) attorney-client privilege, 3) confidential commercial communications, and 4) Statements of fact made to the government during an air crash investigation are not applicable in this case. Accordingly, this appeal is centered on what appears to be a deliberative process privilege assertion by Ms. Connor. The deliberative process privilege only applies to records that are predecisional--records ""prepared in order to assist an agency decisionmaker in arriving at his decision."" (Renegodation Ed v. Grumman Aircraft Eng'gCorp., 421 U.S. 168, 184 (1975). Federal courts have ruled that purely factual material"" that does not reveal the deliberative process is not protected by this exemption.""

Thus, the application itself, any purely factual material related to it, and Amtrak's final determination correspondence are all responsive to Cato's request. On March 15, 2022, AG Garland issued a memo to all agency and departments instructing tl;lat with respect to the implementation of the 2016 statutory updates to the FOIA, ""Information that might technically fall within an exemption should not be withheld from a FOIA requester unless the agency can identify a foreseeable harm or legal bar to disclosure. In case of doubt, openness should prevail. Moreover, agencies are strongly encouraged to make discretionary disclosures of information where appropriate. Amtrak clearly failed to adhere to the AG's instruction in response to Cato's request, and it in no way indicated the specific, articulable foreseeable harm that would result from the release of the information at issue. Accordingly, for all of the above reasons I appeal the (b) (5) withholdings in this request. In order to help to determine my status to assess fees, you should know that I am Senior Fellow and scholar at the Cato Institute, an IRS-recognized 50l(c) (3) nonprofit educational and public interest organization.

With its initial request, Alstom requested a copy of certain documents and records in connection with Amtrak RFP # DOC750069 for the Intercity Trainset Acquisition & Technical Support, Spares, and Supply Agreement (""TSSSA""), including, but not limited to, the following: Exhibit A-1-Amtrak General Provisions Rev #7, dated June 15, 2021.

The date Range for the record search covered the period from 01/01/2019 to 12/15/2023. In response to Alstom's request, Amtrak provided copies of Exhibits B, D, Y, and Z. Amtrak withheld the other documents under FOIA Exemption 4. Alstom does not disagree with this determination with respect to Exhibit D-1, Exhibit H, Exhibit S, or Exhibit AA (the successful proposer's proposal document). However, Alstom disagrees with the determination that Exhibit A-1, Amtrak General Provisions Rev #7, dated June 15, 2021, was properly withheld pursuant to FOIA Exemption 4. As you know, Exemption 4 concerns trade secrets and other confidential business information. The Amtrak General Provisions would have been provided to interested proposers when the subject RFP was issued. It is unclear how the General Provisions, as amended, would include trade secret or other confidential information. As such, Alstom respectfully requests that Amtrak reconsider its determination to withhold Exhibit A-1. (Date Range for Record Search: From 4/30/2024 To 4/30/2024)"

2024-APP-00009,"This is an appeal of FOA 24-FOI-00517 that was entirely denied on two exemptions. First, I need to point out that in my 27 years of journalism, I have never received a denial on any open records request as quickly as I received this from Amtrak, which implies very little legal review or consideration of the law was done, despite the rule that FOIA must be liberally construed. Amtrak already had a predetermined response to reporters trying to do their jobs. There was no thorough understanding of the value of public records and balancing that with privacy concerns, which do not even apply here. Open access is a cornerstone of a free society. But government, especially within the past 8 years, continues to look for ways to deny without balancing this with the law. Lets deal with Exemption 6. Under Katz and its progeny, privacy for an individual requires an expectation of privacy that society will recognize as legitimate. The inquiry into whether individuals have privacy in public resulted in the third-party and plain-view doctrines. The Supreme Court held in California v. Ciraolo that viewing a marijuana field in an airplane did not require a warrant. Why? Although the field was on private property and hidden from a public street, the courts ruled that the field was still in plain view because it could be seen from the aircraft in public airspace.  The video we request is a plain-view video, and we have clarified that we dont need or want the portion of the video that you believe is a violation of privacy. When I mentioned this to an Amtrak representative, she emailed that Amtrak cannot redact videos. But the law states: Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this subsection. If indeed Amtrak is not capable of editing or redacting a video, then it needs to get the software to do it, because you are required by law to segregate exactly what I am requesting. You can segregate the portion of the video that you believe is a violation of privacy. We wont appeal that action. In addition, the Amtrak official told me that this privacy exemption extends to family of the deceased, but this completely misses the point that we are not requesting what you believe is a privacy issue. Its not. But I must point out that there really is no expectation of privacy in public. Anything that happens in plain view cannot trigger the privacy exemption. This leaves little space for privacy. It certainly cannot be triggered when you consider what we are requesting. Courts have even ruled that with the advent and ubiquity of facial recognition, and high-resolution cameras, society no longer has any expectation of privacy in public. In Doe v. Reed, a group in Washington state asked the Supreme Court to block release of their names on a petition that would have required a statewide ballot referendum. Their concern was that identifying them on the petition could cause harm because they held unpopular views. The court did not agree. The irony of this use of the exemption is that the Amtrak camera presumably records everything in public. In fact, there are likely body cam videos that captured everything in public, a Ring video of a nearby home or business, a surveillance camera on top of an electrical pole, a drivers dash cam, a persons cell phone video. No one has an expectation of privacy if it is the government using the cameras and the video however it deems appropriate. Thats not how it works.

Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967) (holding that what one voluntarily exposes to the public is not subject to Fourth Amendment privacy protections). When the privacy interest is minimal and the public interest is great, that disclosure of this information would constitute neither a clearly unwarranted [under Exemption 6], nor an unwarranted [under Exemption 7(C)] invasion of personal privacy. The exemptions that are part and parcel of the FOIA's broad disclosure plan are not to be used to deflect its aim that is focused on openness, not secrecy. The exemptions are exclusive, Mink, 410 U.S. at 79, not to be added to or detracted from, see US. Dept. of Justice v. Tax Analysts, 492 U.S.) to be narrowly construed with doubts resolved in favor of disclosure. See Rose, 425 U.S. at 366. Without any privacy interests to protect, the b(6) exemption cannot apply. Therefore, the video requested in 23-FOI-00336 must be disclosed. ex Notably, Rush County is named in the tort claim notice. This video is necessary for Rush County to defend itself in litigation. Failure to produce the video will result in harm to Rush County. Rush County is entitled to attorney fees following Amtrak's failure to abide by FOIA. 5 USC § 552(a)( 4)(E).

2024-APP-00012,"This is an appeal under the Freedom ofinformation Act. My request dated June 17, 2024 was assigned the tracking number 24-FOI-00557. On July 1, 2024, I received a response to my request in a letter signed by FOIA Officer Rebecca Conner. I appeal the denial of my request. A copy of my request and the agency determination which is the subject of this appeal is attached for your convenience. I appeal the decision to fully deny access to the requested records because a stop work order issued by the federal government to a federal contractor does not meet the threshold for nondisclosure under FOIA Exemption 4. A stop work order issued by the government itself is not a trade secret, nor is it commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential. Though it could contain such information, the government has a ""duty to segregate"" such exempt information from otherwise non-exempt records. This duty is clearly established by the FOIA at 5 U.S.C. § 552 (b). Exemption 4 does not apply to the requested record(s), which should be fully or partially disclosed as they are created and held by the federal government for official purposes. These records contain critical information on the progress of a taxpayer-funded federal project. The existence of an official order from the government for the private contractor to stop work on this project falls well within the scope of disclosure under the FOIA. We do not dispute that the responsive record(s) could contain some information that may be exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 4, such as certain cost and rate data provided by the government contractor that could be characterized as privileged financial information that was obtained from a person, and thus would be ripe for redaction. Gulf & Western Indus. v. United States (D. C. Cir. 1980). Any such information could be redacted as part of a partial disclosure of these records, as is required by the FOIA. Neufeld v. Internal Revenue Serv. (D. C. Cir. 1980) But the stop work order itself is not exempt. The first part of Exemption 4 exempts ""trade secrets"" from disclosure. Responsive records are not a trade secret by any definition. The fact that work on this project has stalled is not a secret, nor is it privileged or confidential - one could see this simply by standing outside Baltimore's Penn Station and observing that construction is not happening. In fact, many jurisdictions proactively disclose stop work orders by posting them online and/or by physically posting notice of the order at the site of a project. The fact that the federal government ordered for a contractor to stop certain work is not in any way ""commercially valuable"" information, nor is it information that is part of the contractor's ""productive process."" Public Citizen Health Research Group v. Food & Drug Administration (D_ C. Cir. 1983) The requested records are also clearly not ""commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential."" Even ifthere was a determination that a stop work order was commercial or financial and privileged or confidential, a stop work order issued by the government could in no way be considered ""obtained from a person.""

On July 16, 2024, Amtrak responded after a search, we have no records responsive to this request. Amtrak does not communicate with the Treasury Department.

By exporting it to PDF, you disregarded my electronic form & format requests - and you additionally rasterized the record, which I specifically asked you not to do. OCR does not cure the destruction of the original structural metadata that makes it accessible, nor make available the parts of the records (such as hyperlinks, headers, etc) which were destroyed by rasterization.

2025-APP-00003,"	Amtrak securities are not publicly traded and would have no market value if they were as no Amtrak service (including the Northeast Corridor) exhibits any prospect of generating shareholder value once on-going capital requirements are factored in. 	Amtrak's preferred stock is held by the U.S. Government. 	Amtrak's pricing is available on its website for all origin-destination pairs, classes of service and is date specific. 	Amtrak's commercial products are publicly available. 	Amtrak publishes a Five-Year Plan clearly outlining its commercial intentions to the public As outlined in note 1 to Amtrak's audited financial reports: ""Without Federal Government funding, Amtrak will not be able to continue to operate in its current form and significant operating changes, restructuring, or bankruptcy may occur."" It is unclear the specific reasons why exemption 4 has been applied: Exemption 4 of the FOIA protects ""trade secrets (what trade secrets? ---historical accounting data has been requested) and commercial (Amtrak's pricing is publicly available-prospective marketing plans, pricing strategies or new product intentions are not requested ) or financial information (Amtrak is not publicly traded---absent on-going state and federal subsidies it would not exist) obtained from a person [that is] privileged or confidential. (again, completely unclear what is privileged or confidential)"" This exemption is intended to protect the interests of both the government and submitters of information. The exemption covers two distinct categories of information in federal agency records: (1) trade secrets; and (2) information that is (a) commercial or financial, (b) obtained from a person, and (c) privileged or confidential. The class 1 freight railroads all make available very detailed financial and operational data both on their websites as well as accessible at the Surface Transportation Board despite operating in a very competitive environment. CSX, by way of example, makes available this report-an example follows: 2023-csxt-r-1.pdf Similar to the APT system this report provides account specific information and is more than 120 pages in length and the data is also available in EXCEL format. The CSX annual report is attached and is detailed-138 pages in length. The freight railroads contribute detailed commercial data in order that the Surface Transportation Board's (STB) CARLOAD WAYBILL SAMPLE can be assembled and made available. The freight railroads contribute detailed accounting information in order that the STB UNIFORM RAIL COSTING SYSTEM can be used to determine the profitability of specific movements of freight. To conclude, this is a request for historical accounting data and not prospective forecasts or commercial plans. The data requested supports existing Amtrak historical reporting data that is market specific. Fully understanding that Amtrak is ""private"" it does not have publicly traded shares nor is controlled by any private individual, private corporation nor publicly stock traded entities. The freight railroads are privately owned with securities that are principally publicly traded and operate in a highly competitive commercial environment. Yet, substantial data that is unredacted is made available. I would appreciate your reconsideration of Amtrak withholding this historical accounting information generated under the umbrella of protocols originating with the Volpe Center in Cambridge, MA.

I specifically object to the redactions under exemption 4. I object to the exemption 4 redactions, because information about the condition of the bridge that is contained in the inspection reports I requested is undeniably in the public interest. I requested these documents after a chunk of concrete fell from the bridge onto a car, injuring the driver and triggering an inspection of the bridge. This sort of event and the information in the inspection reports I requested are highly relevant to the public, especially to the people who daily use the heavily-trafficked road under the bridge. This information should not be categorized as a trade secret, information that is commercial or financial, information that is obtained from a person, or information that is privileged and confidential. It should be categorized as publicly-relevant inspection reports. I don't have any objections to the redactions under FOIA exemption 6. Thank you for considering my appeal.

2025-APP-00005,"I submit for your consideration, with CC to Mr. Herrmann, my appeal to your response regarding private railcar operations (Tracking No. 25-FOI-00174) to ensure Amtrak is considering the following points: Historical Aggregated Data Is Not Proprietary 	The request pertains to historical financial and operational statistics that do not identify specific private businesses or commercial arrangements. 	Similar revenue and movement data have been published in Amtrak reports without triggering Exemption 4. Exemption 5 Does Not Apply to Factual Data 	The request does not seek internal policy discussions or pre-decisional materials but instead finalized operational data spanning two decades. 	FOIA mandates that purely factual material should be disclosed, unless it reveals internal deliberations (EPA v. Mink). Public Interest Justifies Disclosure 	This information is essential for evaluating private railcar policy, Amtraks handling of heritage equipment, and economic contributions to the network. 	As Amtrak is a publicly funded entity, transparency in its private car operations supports industry and legislative decision-making. Given these points, I request a full release of the requested data or a more detailed justification for the exemptions applied. Please confirm the status of my appeal and any next steps.

When he fell on me his arm went into my side and all of his weight seem to go there. The man reeked of alcohol and he had urinated in his pants. I pushed him off of me , he stood up and continue to the back of the train walking very unsteady. He fell on another lady and her child. He then collapsed in the aisle. The conductor and an attendant came to the car to see what was going on with the man. They spoke with him And they called an ambulance. They arranged for the ambulance to meet the train at a crossroad. The paramedics tried to check the man out and he refused any medical attention or examination. I spoke with the conductor and the attendant . I told them that the man had fallen on me and hurt me. They ask me if I needed any medical attention and at the time there was nothing I could do I couldnt get off the train to get medical attention because I had my four-year-old granddaughter and 10-year-old Grandson with me. The conductor arranged for the passenger to be taken off the train at the next stop. A short while later an employee came to my seat and gave me a paper to fill out about the incident. I was in very much pain over the next few days and I went to see my family physician. It was my understanding that I may have a bruised kidney or something. Since that time I have had numerous doctors appointments, including a neuro surgeon, pain specialist , and tests. I have had two CAT scans an MRI and Three x-rays. I have a ruptured disc at T7 In my thoracic spine, and a very serious displacement of a vertebrae in my lumbar spine. I am now under the care of an orthopedic surgeon, who has requested I get another MRI. He says my injuries are very serious. I would like to get the mans Information who fell on me and injured me. Amtrack would not release this information to me because of privacy reasons. I have a cumulated thousand dollars worth of bills for the tests ,doctors visits , etc. I need to get in contact with this man as soon as possible so I can try and get some compensation from him. Thank you for your time I will be waiting for your response. Sincerely, Belinda Jarema."

For horn blowing related to track work:  At what distance away from the work site can a train start blowing its horn, e.g., 1 mile away, 5 miles away, 20 miles away?  Are crews normally scheduled to work on a track between the hours of 10:00 pm and 7:00am?  Is Amtrak required to follow a local or state governments noise ordinance laws that prohibit loud and excessive noises during certain hours?  If Amtrak has different policies for different regions of the country, the answers to these questions can be narrowed to the North East Regional Line. Noise complaints:  Does Amtrak notify the public of when track work will be conducted in their area and how long the track work is expected to last? If yes, where or how? If no, why not?  How can residents who live near train tracks inquire about train horn noise (i.e. what phone number do they call or web form do they fill out to investigate their concerns)? If no method is available, why does Amtrak not facilitate communication between the company and the residents it most regularly and strongly affects?"

21-FOI-00077,"I hereby request all of the following information: 1. As discussed here: https://ctexaminer.com/2021/01/29/amtrak-settles-ada-claims-for-stations-in-connecticut-and-rhode-island/ (last visited May 14, 2021), which reads, ""CT Examiner asked the Department of Justice and Amtrak why Old Saybrook is listed as one of the eligible stations despite not being listed in the complaint, and why New London is not listed as an eligible station even though it was listed in the complaint. Neither immediately responded on Friday."", it appears that the issue stations, for Connecticut, might vary. Why? Why would the issue stations vary like this? 2. The compensation amount, which varies based on tier, has an unknown amount, which has a maximum of $833.33, and to find the compensation amount is either multiplied by 1 or 3, depending on tier. Why is this the amount? Is there any legal, or any other reason or rationale, that this is the amount? ...and that that is the maximum amount? Could this amount be higher? (Not under the settlement, but is it possible under law?) What does this amount compensate for? 3. A. Why was this matter handled exclusively under the ADA? I note that 42 USC §12131(1)(C) defines a public entity as the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, and thus the ADA's inclusion. 3. B. With regard to the Rehabilitation Act, is that inapplicable for some reason? Lots of time numerous laws can actually apply. Presumably there is some federal funding involved here. And the owner appears to be the United States in that Amtrak is owned by its stockholders, which are only the United States. 3. C. With regard to state disability law, Connecticut disability law, is that inapplicable for some reason? It would seem that law could apply if, for example, there was enough involvement with a company or with the state, like using their property or land. It would seem there is enough for this law to apply. 4. This settlement agreement contains no opt out or other methodology to remove yourself or not be bound by the settlement. 4. A. How is that legally sufficient, permissible and compliant? 4. B. Also, under legal concepts, e.g., due process, is there an opt out anyway? As in, even though there isn't one listed, does an opt out still exist? 4. C. Please tell me how to opt out and proceed individually. 5. What is the best methodology to utilize to to address/raise issues? Would it be contacting/with the DOJ? Since the DOJ helps with this stuff. Would it be Amtrak? Who would be best to direct issues to, and seek assistance, guidance and help from? An example of an issue would be that the settlement doesn't properly or fully compensate. And to seek that compensation. 6. Punitive Damages: are they legally possible and available here? Punitive damages appear like they might be available, if not under the Rehabilitation Act, or the ADA, it appears that Connecticut law might afford such relief. Connecticut law seems like it might apply if, for example, Amtrak made itself a public accommodation, maybe by not being on federal land, like involving a business or state... and might apply because law seems to expose Amtrak to state law (note law cite/quotation a bit below). From your view are punitive damages available? Why? See: 49 U.S.C. § 28103(a)(1) ""...with a conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights... of others"""
21-FOI-00078,"I hereby request all of the following information: Questions: 1. In a settlement such as this, since the class at issue likely has a notable percent of people receiving means tested based aid, is there any exemption for received compensation allowed by law? (Or) Does the DOJ or a judge have the power to grant such an exemption? Exemption meaning the received funds simply don't count for means tested programs. I recall seeing this before. The rationale was essentially that since a discriminated party receives a means tested program benefit, the compensation should be exempt or, essentially, they would get nothing as the provided compensation would simply reduce the benefit provided proportionately. For example, in source of income discrimination for housing, it would make no sense to compensate the person, who was discriminated against for receiving housing aid, only to reduce that aid proportionately to the compensation (then there would be, effectively, no compensation). So, is there any exemption? Either already applicable or possible to be pursued/obtained? 2. Why are taxes mentioned for this case? Wouldn't taxes only be of issue if the financial amount given was other than compensation? Like the amount was punitive damages? 3. Can the DOJ aid me in pursuing fair compensation here? How can I request that aid? 4. Can the Department of Transportations Federal Railroad Administration Office of Civil Rights provide any assistance to me pursuing fair compensation here? How can I request that aid? 5. Can I pursue Amtrak individually here? Via arbitration? Do I have to complain to the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities first? 6. It would seem CUTPA (the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act) is applicable to Amtrak. See, e.g.,: 49 U.S.C. § 28103(a)(1) ""Notwithstanding any other statutory or common law or public policy, or the nature of the conduct giving rise to damages or liability, in a claim for personal injury to a passenger, death of a passenger, or damage to property of a passenger arising from or in connection with the provision of rail passenger transportation, or from or in connection with any rail passenger transportation operations over or rail passenger transportation use of right-of-way or facilities owned, leased, or maintained by any high-speed railroad authority or operator, any commuter authority or operator, any rail carrier, or any State, punitive damages, to the extent permitted by applicable State law, may be awarded in connection with any such claim..."" (italics added/mine) In your view is this law (CUTPA) applicable? This section seems to make clear that Amtrak is fully exposed to state law... and that state law is applicable to Amtrak."

I am requesting all documents relating to the following incident which occurred on October 21, 2021 during travel on Amtrak Train No. 449 (the Lake Shore Limited} between Springfield and Pittsfield, MA. I was a passenger on that train. When the train reached the general vicinity of Westfield, MA the train made an unscheduled stop at a rail crossing. Out the window of the train I observed local police interacting with Amtrak personnel from the train. After about a half-hour delay, the train resumed its travel to Pittsfield. A conductor on the train informed me that a passenger had become unruly and that Amtrak personnel had to determine whether the passenger needed to be removed from the train, perhaps with the assistance of local police. It was ultimately determined that the passenger could continue to ride. When the train reached Pittsfield, where I debarked, local police were on hand and questioned the Amtrak conductor who advised the police that further action was not warranted. I am assuming that an incident of this nature, since it involved a significant delay on a long distance train, would have required the preparation and filing of a report by Amtrak personnel, such as the conductor on the train. No explanation for the delay was provided to passengers on the train, at least those seated in my car. Please advise if a fee will be charged for the copy I am requesting.

I agree to pay reasonable fees for the processing of this request up to $50. Please notify me before incurring any expenses in excess of that amount. For fee categorization purposes, I am a representative of the news media. Through this request, I am gathering information for my journalistic work with SFGATE, a daily news site with 30 million monthly readers.

The following information should include, but not be limited to, name, location, description of incident, charges, dates and time of incident. FORMAT OF REQUESTED RECORDS Under FOIA, you are obligated to provide records in the format requested. See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(B) (In making any record available to a person under this paragraph, an agency shall provide the record in any form or format requested by the person if the record is readily reproducible by the agency in that form or format.). We request all records in an electronic spreadsheet format or a CSV file. Please provide all records on a rolling basis.  RESPONSE TIME We appreciate your help in expeditiously obtaining a determination on the requested records. As mandated in FOIA, we anticipate a reply within the statutory timeframe of 20 business days. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i). FEE WAIVER I respectfully request that you waive all fees in connection with this request as provided by 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). FOIA was designed to provide citizens a broad right to access government records. FOIAs basic purpose is to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny, with a focus on the publics right to be informed about what their government is up to. U.S. Dept of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 77374 (1989). In order to provide public access to this information, FOIAs fee waiver provision requires that [d]ocuments . . . be furnished without any charge or at a [reduced] charge . . . if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Disclosure to The New York Times will contribute to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government and is not in the commercial interest of the requester. EXPEDITED PROCESSING There can be little doubt that The Times constitutes a requester ""primarily engaged in disseminating information."" 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). There can also be little doubt that the requests relate to federal government activity; I am requesting expedited processing of this request because it concerns a matter of both urgency and of public concern. See id. ""[I]f production [ of the requested records] is unduly delayed, both [The Times] and the public at large will be 'precluded ... from obtaining in a timely fashion information vital to the current and ongoing debate surrounding ... ' a high-profile government action."" Protect Democracy Project, Inc. v. US. Dep 't of Defense, 263 F. Supp. 3d 293, 298-99 (D.D.C. 2017).

23-FOI-00082,"I am requesting an unredacted report # 22007174. I believe I am entitled to this report. An Amtrak employee created this report when they observed my car being hit. The accident occurred in New York. In this jurisdiction, Section 66-a states that: ""Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of law, general, special or local, or any limitation contained in the provision of any city charter, all reports and records of any accident, kept or maintained by the state police or by the police department or force of any county, city, town, village or other district of the state, shall be open to the inspection of any person having an interest therein, or of such person's attorney or agent, even though the state or a municipal corporation or other subdivision thereof may have been involved in the accident; except that the authorities having custody of such reports or records may prescribe reasonable rules and regulations in regard to the time and manner of such inspection, and may withhold from inspection any reports or records the disclosure of which would interfere with the investigation or prosecution by such authorities of a crime involved in or connected with the accident."" The NY State Committee on Open Government commented on this law; their comments suggest I should have access: In sum, it is our view, based on the language of the law and its judicial construction, that motor vehicle accident reports must be disclosed in their entirety, except in two circumstances: the first would involve a situation in which portions may be withheld because disclosure would ""interfere with the investigation or prosecution...of a crime involved in or connected with the accident; and the second with a situation in which accident victims names and addresses are sought for a commercial purpose. Finally, my property has been damaged and from this report it is known by Amtrak that my property was damaged. I am seeking information so I can appropriately file an insurance claim to restore my property. It would obstruct my effort for Amtrak to redact the report.

I'm trying to put together a case to present to Paul O'mara and Joe Morris in Chicago to fight to keep BTL open. That being said, I'm looking for specific information that might help build that case.  The specific information I'm looking for falls under a few categories. First, management in Chicago has presented to the State of Michigan and MDOT that closing BTL will save the state 2 million annually, but when asked to show the specifics behind how that closure will save 2 million, no information is forthcoming. How does management get to that 2 million in saving for closing BTL crew base? Second, and along the same lines, I was wondering if I could get the specifics for current crew bases running in Michigan? What are the current annual budgets for crews in CHR (Chicago road; that works into BTL), BTL, and PNT (Pontiac, Michigan). Not just salary for trainmen and engineers, but also the cost of transportation and lodging for said T&E for the three lasted crew bases.  Third, and still in the budget realm, what were the budgets (again including salary, lodging and transportation) of said crew bases (CHR, BTL, PNT) pre-covid? Prior to covid, the work from Battle Creek to Chicago was split evenly between CHR and BTL.  A similar case to the current push to close BTL, was experienced in Lincoln, Nebraska. A few years ago, management decided to close LNC and move that work to Denver, Colorado. Up front, they were saying that optimization was showing the company would save money running those trains out of DEN and closing LNC. That being said, two years later, they had to reverse that decision and reopen LNC bc of an assortment of unexpected costs associated with running that work out of DEN (Recrews, transportation, lodging, service recovery from late trains, etc.). Since we in Michigan feel this is a similar case to ours, we were looking for the specific financial information used to justify closing LNC initially, and then the financial information that was used to justify reopening LNC two years later. We'd rather prevent the closing of the crew base for a few years before management realizes the mistake they've made.  And last, I was looking for response time for recrewing trains out of the three crew bases of CHR, BTL, and PNT. Our hope is to show that with BTL being a midpoint crew base, the data will show that it will have a faster average response time to rescue/recrew trains thus showing the importance of keeping trainmen and engineers at a ready point able to respond to any sort of situation.  If you could help me formalize my questions in a way so as to get the information I need to present a good case to keep my and my co-workers crew base from closing, I would greatly appreciate it."

Please provide how Amtrak combats against the unaccountable and intimidation of executive bullying within Amtrak's executive ranks and if they have any self-awareness of mistreatment of the innocent both employee as well as the public What Bullying Is Costing Your Company When you, as the leader of an organization allow bullying to occur you create at least five problems: 1. The target of the bullying will experience a loss of confidence and an increase in stress that often shows up in health problems. Their performance will decline. They may need more time off to recover. So you have lower performance by at least one person, the target. 2. By allowing the bullying to continue you are accepting a toxic culture, prevalent Critter State, and reduced performance and morale. The people witnessing the bullying will have to choose to side with the bully, leave, risk retribution by speaking out, or remain passive and try to stay under the bullys radar. To be non-threatening to the bully they may lower their performance in some way. 3. Eventually the target will have no recourse but to leave. Research has shown that the vast majority of targets eventually leave. You now have lost a good employee and have all the costs of a new hire. 4. Plus you have the almost certain guarantee that the cycle will repeat itself. I find that organizations which condone bullying, which have prevalent Critter State, also have high employee turnover rates, far less revenue per employee, increased absences, and the list goes on and on. 5. You are opening yourself up to potential litigation. While bullying is not, strictly speaking, illegal it may be connected to a form of harassment or discrimination which can be subject to litigation. At the least attention will be taken up in tracking and proving a case. All this from denying bullyingoh, and lets add the personal guilt of not protecting ones tribe.

This Environmental Review work must be completed before we can finalize the approval of the project were seeking to fund. Below are the questions we need answers to, which Im hoping you can provide. -length of train that passes -are tracks bolted or welded? -is there a crossing within 3,000 feet where train horns are blown? -Is Train electric or diesel? -Average Train Speed -Number of train engines per train? -Number of railway cars per train? -Average train operations (total yearly railway traffic volume for each train type in both directions) The project site is at 27 & 29 Industrial Blvd in Paoli, PA. We must consider railways within 3,000 feet in all directions. There are two railways to the North, and two to the South within 3,000 feet. Im new to this type of work, so Im still learning some of the resources for info that Ive been pointed to. One of those resources is the US DOTs Federal Railroad Administrations Safety Map. From their site, I was able to acquire some numbers that may help with identification of railways. The closest crossing is 531329C (FRAARCID 422806). Im requesting answers to the above questions for each railway and associated Amtrak trains; if you have that information. I dont really understand what is going on, but it seems like Amtrak may own the railway, but NS and SEPTA are running trains on it?

This incident resulted in severe injuries while I was operating a Taylor-Dunn Bigfoot cart. Despite repeated requests during the discovery process in my ongoing legal case (Case No. 30-2020-01170379-CU-MC-NJC, Superior Court of California, County of Orange), the defense has refused to disclose the insurance report. This report is crucial to my case, as it allegedly finds Amtrak 100% at fault for the incident. Given the refusal to provide this report and the presence of fabricated evidence, false witness testimony, and manipulated video evidence, I believe there may be underlying issues that warrant investigation. I am concerned about the integrity of the processes and the potential concealment of critical information that affects my case. I respectfully request that your office investigate this matter and assist in facilitating access to the insurance report.

There appears to be only $4.3 billion in IIJA supplemental funding to address what is now a $7 billion long-distance fleet procurement. Please provide insight as to Amtrak's current expectations regarding how the bi-level RFP will be funded given the reported need for $7 billion to invest but little more than $4 billion uto obligate. see attached for further detail  (Date Range for Record Search: From 01/01/2023 To 11/21/2024)"

By way of example, attached is a pdf listing all pieces of equipment either overhauled or having brake tests performed by Amtrak mechanical forces. Included are cars released subsequent to wreck repairs being performed. All of this equipment is reported as ""inactive"" to FRA. All but one unit is reported as ""stored"". Of the ""stored"" cars 11 are reported as ""wrecked"" despite the fact that this equipment was released from maintenance facilities such as Beech Grove during the last half of FY24. Collectively, this makes no sense. Separately, there are locomotives that were overhauled in FY24 that are not reported to FRA as even existing. Unit numbers 517 and 579 were released from the diesel switcher overhaul program in Feb 2024 and Sep 2024, respectively, but are omitted from the report to FRA.

25-FOI-00202,"In November 2024 Amtrak's Jim Blair advised Florida Department of Transportation that Amtrak would not relocate its Miami station from Hialeah to the Miami Intermodal Center. As recently as March 16, 2024 Amtrak had advised Congress in its General and Legislative Report & FY2025 Grant Request that the relocation was a certainty. Given that Amtrak executed a contractual agreement with Florida DOT in 2013 to facilitate operation to the Intermodal Center it is inconceivable how, once a certainty less than one year ago, Amtrak has reversed what Floridian's believed to be a commitment. The $2 billion Miami Intermodal Center was constructed at significant cost to Floridians. A fully equipped Amtrak station was constructed within this facility. Once again, I request a copy of Mr. Blair's June 7, 2024 email to Kim Holland at FDOT outlining Amtrak's terms and conditions for relocating.

25-FOI-00206,"These are follow-up questions for 25-FOI-00202. Incremental train & engine crew labor is projected to increase by 10% which is entirely attributed to operating both long distance trains 4 miles beyond the Hialeah station (8 miles RT). Similarly, incremental on-board labor is projected to increase by 10% as well for the same reason. These increased incremental costs require further explanation as inbound trains will run through to the airport (avoiding Hialeah) from Hollywood to discharge passengers and then return 4 miles to Hialeah for servicing. Similarly, trains will reposition from Hialeah servicing to the airport (4 miles) for passenger boarding and departure north running non-stop to Hollywood, FL. Please explain the reason behind increased ""Reservation and Call Centers? What increased manpower is required to support an average of 52 passengers per calendar day fully acknowledging that many transactions are fully automated and paperless. Does Amtrak actually incur incremental cash costs of $10.10 cents per passenger? Please explain. Station and Facility costs for both long-distance trains are projected to increase by fully 27% from $2.2 million to $2.8 million. Please provide an explanation behind this increase. Amtrak will avoid on-going operating costs for the Hialeah station--have they been incorporated in this analysis and how much? What comprises the $600,000 in additional incremental annual costs. Please reveal the rental FDOT expects Amtrak to pay? What are the other components of this increase? Please provide a clear and concise explanation regarding what ""initial capital improvements"" are required at the MIC? Additional explanation would appear to be in order regarding what has changed over the past twelve years. Amtrak executed a contract amendment with FDOT in 2013 to provide contractual authority for Amtrak to operate into the Miami Intermodal Center. Moreover, Amtrak operated at least one test train to the Center subsequent to the highway bypass being installed by FDOT. Eleven months ago, Amtrak reported to Congress in the General and Legislative Annual Report & FY 2025 Grant Request that, "" The company does expect to move its Miami station stop, served by the Silver Star and Silver Meteor, from the current location (next to a freight railroad yard in the Hialeah neighborhood) to the Miami Intermodal Center (MIC) at Miami International Airport. There are legitimate concerns, in Florida, regarding whether these estimates have been ""manufactured"" to justify a preordained decision. To illustrate, Amtrak submitted an ADA Progress Report to the US Department of Justice reporting progress in upgrading the accessibility of facilities. Although the Congressional report advised Senators and House members that the relocation was imminent, the ADA report to DOJ reported that Amtrak had, prior to May 1, 2024, executed a construction contract to upgrade Hialeah thus apparently dooming the relocation.

25-FOI-00207,"This is a second follow-up question pertaining to the work product provided as part of 25-FOI-00202. All class 1 railroads including Amtrak are required to submit employee compensation data to the Surface Transportation Board. Attached is a recap of reporting for the full calendar year 2023 for each railroad's train & engine employees. According to this data (sourced from the STB website), Amtrak's train and engine crew employees were paid an average of $47.11 per service hour during calendar year 2023 (which includes the first quarter of Amtrak's FY25 accounting year). Even if one adds fringe benefits (e.g. amtrak portion of retirement taxes, health & welfare, medicare, etc.) it is very difficult to reconcile how the incremental t&e labor costs to operate an additional 4 miles from Hialeah to the Miami Airport totals the $2.2 million that Amtrak FP&A has estimated.

I was not aware of this mistake as all my other travel arrangements were around this weekend including my train ticket NYC to DC on Feb 17th. The main conductor, after speaking to reservations stated I would need to pay $500 for a first class ticket as there were no other tickets available. I had an important event to attend in NYC by 5 p.m. and I requested to just remain in the dining for the duration of the trip using my March 15th ticket which was an error with date. The conductor refused and stated he would contact railroad police to exit me from the train in New Haven CT. The police were at the stop and I left the train on my own even though I think it was much to do about a simple mistake and me seated in the dining car should not have been an issue. The conductor stated he would be doing a report and the railroad police took my info and brought me to the ticket window to purchase new tickets and I assume they have done a report as well. I would like under the FOIA to obtain both the conductors report and the police report and any other report concerning this matter on Feb, 15, 2025. Thank You..
